# CP3402 Assignment 2 - Group I - Theme Details

The layout of the required content was achieved by customizing a WordPress starter theme and making modifications as needed. Additional CSS was utilized through plugins and a code editor to fine-tune specific details. It is important to exercise caution and thoroughness when making changes to the theme templates as altering blocks and content can significantly impact the overall architecture and structure of the website.

## Theme Details and features

This is a light theme, which uses colours from the Baizonn logo, slightly changed to increase contrast and improve readability. This theme will be usable on any other website with changes to the coolour scheme from the Baizonn colours to a more relevant colour scheme.

### Typography

#### 

#### Font
We are using the [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) font for our primary font from Google Fonts which is published under the Open Font License meaning it is free for commercial use. The font provides an elegant look that is easy to read.

The fonts are set using the following variables set within custom_vars_mixins.scss:
- $font__main
- $font__code
- $font__pre

### Colours

The client requested we maintain the 'yellow' colour theme, so we have maintained that with a gold and grey that meshes well with the existing logo.

These colours are set using the following variables set within custom_vars_mixins.scss:
- $color__text-main
- $color__link
- $color__link-visited
- $color__link-hover
- $color__background-body
- $color__border-main_panel
- $color__background-main_panel


Colours were generated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co).
